# Description

The figure shows how much of each type of energy source (nodes on the left) were consumed by each of the Calgary city facilities (nodes on the right) aggregated over the year 2023. The area of each node is proportional to the total amount of energy consumed or provided by each energy or business enitity in 2023. The nodes are arranged from top to bottom in descending order of total energy consumption. The edges represent a specific energy type being used by a specific business, aggregated over the same time period, and the edge-color represents the amount in Kwh according to the colorbar. For clarity, the thickness of the edges is proportional to the log of the energy consumption. All energies were converted to Kwh prior to this analysis, and only the year 2023 is considered.

The biggest energy sources were natural gas (638 Gwh) and electricy (443 Gwh), together accounting for more than 98% of the energy consumption. The 3 largest consumers of energy were 'Water Services' (324 Gwh), 'Calgary Transit' (268 Gwh), and 'Facilities' (246Gwh), together accounting for about 76% of all energy consumed over the year. 'Facilities' made use of all 4 energy sources, but the top two consumers used all sources except for 'District Energy'. Electricity was the most widely used source, with all business entities except for 'Calgary Housing' making use of it. Natural gas was the second most common provider, with the exception of 'Downtown Strategy' and 'Utilities Delivery'.
